        <h2>Dscripton:</h2>
        <p>The word Adobo was derived from the Spanish word “adobar”. It means to marinate. This can be in the form of a liquid marinade or to rub using a combination of powdered ingredient.</p>


           <p> This version of Filipino Adobo version suggests marinating the pork in soy sauce and crushed garlic. By preference, vinegar can also be added as a marinade ingredient.</p>
            
           <p>Mexican adobo, on the other hand, makes use of chillies, garlic, cinnamon, and oregano as marinade.
            Both dishes look and taste different. It will be unfair to compare which among the two dishes are best because each of us has our own preference when it comes to flavor.</p>
