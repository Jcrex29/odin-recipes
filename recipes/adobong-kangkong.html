            <h2>Dscripton:</h2>
              <p>Adobong Kangkong is a simple vegetable dish that is considered a staple in many Filipino homes. Water Spinach which is locally known as Kangkong is the main ingredient for this healthy vegetable dish.</p>

              <p>There are several varieties of Kangkong. In the Philippines, the most common variety is the wide-leaf ones; these are usually seen floating (if not intentionally grown) in watery areas. Another variety is the Chinese Spinach or Water Cabbage which is locally known as Chinese Kangkong.</p>
                
              <p>Although the preparation for this dish is very simple, it is recommended to exert some time and effort in cleaning the vegetable. Since Kangkong easily grows and multiplies in watery areas, we never know how clean (or dirty) they are when sold in the market.</p>
                
              <p>I usually add slices of pork to make this dish more flavorful â€“ not a bad idea. After my latest trip to the Philippines, I learned that using lots of toasted garlic in making this dish makes it taste better while promoting better health.</p>
