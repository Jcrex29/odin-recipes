# odin-recipes
This is a project from The Odin Project where I am learning right now, this project is called Odin Recipes. In this project I 
make a Website about Adobo Recipes purely with just html basics. I created 4 total of files, 1 is the index and the other 3 are 
the adobo recipes pages which are pork adobo,adobong kangkong, and chicken adobo. 
    
The index(home page) contains the links of the recipe pages and the recipe pages contains the image and the info of each 
recipe such as description of the recipe, ingredients, and steps.
